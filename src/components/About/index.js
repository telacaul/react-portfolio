                        <p>Hi! My name is Richard Brian Santos and I am a graduate from San Francisco State University
                        with a bachelors in Anthropology. I am at my happiest when I am learning and I am very
                        passionate about technology. Coding is very fascinating, challenging and a rewarding experience. I cannot wait to learn more and enhance my coding
                            skills!</p>

                        <p>On my free time, I love hanging out with my family and friends. If it is just hanging out at
                        home or going out to eat, I will always make time for them. I also love to travel and I hope
                        to travel to places that I havn't been before such as, Europe and other parts of Asia. So
                        far I have been to Mexico, Canada, Japan, and Thailand. Cannot wait for the next adventure!
